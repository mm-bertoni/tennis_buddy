## Project Objective

Tennis Buddy addresses the common problem of finding available tennis courts and hitting partners on campus. Students often struggle to coordinate court bookings and find players of similar skill levels for practice sessions. This application provides a centralized platform where students can:

1. **Search and book available tennis courts** with real-time availability checking
2. **Find hitting partners** by posting their availability and skill level
3. **Manage their reservations** and connect with the tennis community

The application solves real pain points faced by tennis players on campus, making it easier to organize practice sessions and build a stronger tennis community.

- **Deployment**: Render/Railway (ready to deploy)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher) âœ… Installed
- MongoDB Atlas Account âœ… Configured

### Quick Start (Current Setup)

**This project is already configured and ready to run!** 

The environment is set up with:
- âœ… Dependencies installed
- âœ… MongoDB Atlas connected
- âœ… Database seeded with sample data
- âœ… Environment variables configured

**To start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Environment Variables (Already Configured)

The `.env` file is configured with:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration (Atlas Cloud)
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://812249072:****@cluster0.mjacxti.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
DB_NAME=tennis_buddy
PORT=3000

# JWT Secret (for authentication)
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-this-in-production

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```



### Production Deployment

**MongoDB Atlas is already configured!** You can use the same database for production or create a separate production database.

#### Using Render (Recommended)

1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Render
2. **Create a new Web Service** with these settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Environment: Node.js

3. **Set environment variables** in Render dashboard:
   - `MONGO_URI`: `mongodb+srv://812249072:****@cluster0.mjacxti.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
   - `DB_NAME`: `tennis_buddy` (or `tennis_buddy_prod` for separate prod DB)
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Strong secret key for production
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`

4. **Deploy** and get your live URL

#### Using Railway

1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Railway
2. **Add environment variables**:
   - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string (same as above)
   - `DB_NAME`: `tennis_buddy` (or create separate prod database)
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Strong secret key for production
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
3. **Deploy** automatically

#### Production Database Options

**Option 1: Use existing database** (Quick deployment)
- Use the same `tennis_buddy` database already seeded
- Set `DB_NAME=tennis_buddy` in production

**Option 2: Separate production database** (Recommended)
- Create a new database in MongoDB Atlas: `tennis_buddy_prod`
- Set `DB_NAME=tennis_buddy_prod` in production
- Run `npm run seed` once after deployment to populate production data

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development server with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Production server
npm start

# Seed/reseed database (takes 2-3 minutes)
npm run seed

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Troubleshooting

**Port 3000 already in use?**
```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or change the port in .env file
PORT=3001
```

**Database connection issues?**
- Check your MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist (Network Access)
- Verify your database credentials in the `.env` file
- Ensure your internet connection is stable

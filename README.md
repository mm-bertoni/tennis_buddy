## Project Objective

Tennis Buddy addresses the common problem of finding available tennis courts and hitting partners on campus. Students often struggle to coordinate court bookings and find players of similar skill levels for practice sessions. This application provides a centralized platform where students can:

1. **Search and book available tennis courts** with real-time availability checking
2. **Find hitting partners** by posting their availability and skill level
3. **Manage their reservations** and connect with the tennis community

The application solves real pain points faced by tennis players on campus, making it easier to organize practice sessions and build a stronger tennis community.
